        <p> Tigers, the majestic striped big cats, are facing extinction. Their numbers have plummeted due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. If urgent conservation measures aren't implemented, these magnificent predators could vanish from the wild within decades, leaving an irreplaceable void in Earth's ecosystems.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The flightless dodo bird and the beloved giant panda face imminent extinction threats. Overhunting and habitat loss wiped out the dodo in the 17th century. Pandas' bamboo habitats are dwindling, and their low birth rates exacerbate survival challenges. Urgent conservation efforts are crucial to prevent these iconic species from vanishing forever.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Rhinoceros, once abundant, face imminent extinction due to relentless poaching for their horns. Conservation efforts struggle against ruthless criminal networks fueling illegal wildlife trade. Without urgent action, these magnificent creatures may vanish forever from our planet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Indian government has implemented strict laws, created protected areas, launched conservation programs, regulated hunting and wildlife trade, and promoted awareness campaigns to reduce the extinction of animals in the country.</p>
